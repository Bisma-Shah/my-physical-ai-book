# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots. This textbook teaches **Physical AI** – AI systems that operate in the physical world with embodied intelligence.

## Course Overview
Students will learn to bridge digital AI and physical bodies, designing and controlling humanoid robots in simulated and real environments using tools like ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac™.

## Why Physical AI Matters
Humanoid robots are ideal for human-centered environments because they share our physical form. They can be trained with real-world data, marking a shift from digital-only AI to embodied intelligence that understands physics and interacts naturally.
